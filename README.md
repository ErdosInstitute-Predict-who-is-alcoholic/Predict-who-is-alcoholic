#Classification of Alcoholic EEG Signals

#may22-themis Team: Azeezat Azeez and Miriam Sierra

#Background: Electroencephalography

The EEG(Electroencephalography) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique used  to record electrical activity from the scalp, representative of real time neural activity at high temporal resolution.
In Clinical setting EEG is primary used to diagnose Epilepsy

#Project Description: Predict who is an Alcoholic?
Data: Open-source EEG data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
	https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Database
Description: This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism.
	It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps which were sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second.
Subjects: Two Groups
	Alcoholic 
	Control 
Data Sets: 
	Training:  20 unique patients (10 control/10 alcoholic) 30 trials per patient


Motivation: Preventive Care & Improved Social Welfare
14M  people suffer from alcohol use disorder in the US 
Current method of diagnosis is largely qualitative (self reports) which can introduce bias 
The quantitative  ability to diagnose discover high risk individuals based on biomarkers of EEG data has real world benefits:
Medical: Identify  high risk and vulnerable populations→ Preventive Care 
Social: Reduce the social burden → Improve Social Welfare 
Financial: Preventive Care +  Improve Social Welfare

In Clinical setting EEG is primary used to diagnose Epilepsy

	Data: Open-source EEG data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
		https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Database
	Description: This data arises from a large study to examine EEG correlates of genetic predisposition to alcoholism.
		It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps which were sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second.
	Subjects: Two Groups
		Alcoholic 
		Control 
	Data Sets: 
		Training:  20 unique patients (10 control/10 alcoholic) 30 trials per patient
